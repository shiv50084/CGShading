In this practical the files used are the following:

Files				Description
====================		=====================
utils.c				Some general utilities that I need.
utils.h				Header of utils.c
vectors.c			Some vector utilities(Lot's of them are from Graphic Gems Repository)
vectors.h			Header of vectors.c
transformations.c		Transoformations of vertices and points
transformations.h		Header of transformations.c
projections.c			Projections of vertices and points
projections.h			Header of projections.c
shadings.c			Lighting and Shading of object
shadings.h			Header of shadings.c
demo.c				Main file
demo.h				Header of main file
MIT_teapot.obj			Object to be coloured.
README				This file
Makefile			The make file to build this project


Building this project
------------------------
Just use the following command:

s0954319: make

If you want to make a change and want to build it again then do cleaning
and then make:

s0954319: make clean
s0954319: make


Running this project
-------------------------
The file that will be produced after building will be demo. So you run it as
following:

s0954319: ./demo  MIT_teapot.obj <shading algorithm>

<shading algorithm>: flat, gouraud, phong


Using some keyboards keys and mouse you can interact with the object.These are
the following:

ARROW KEYS:		Translation of object.
< or > :		Rotation in Y axis.
PG UP or PG DOWN:	Rotation in X axis.
( or ) :		Rotation in Z axis.
+ or - :		Scaling object.
[ or ] :		Perspective projection.
F1 :			RED Colour
F2 :			GREEN Colour
F3 :			BLUE Colour
F4 :			WHITE Colour
ESC:			Exit from the application.
MOUSE BUTTONS:
	LEFT BUTTON:	Pressing the left button you put a light source in the x, y coordinates of the mouse pointer. Each 
			time you press the button the z value increases by 50 up to 500. Then it starts from position -500.
	RIGHT BUTTON:	Pressing the right button you put the camera in the x, y coordinates of the mouse pointer. Each time 
			you press the button the z value increases by 50 up to 500. Then it starts from position -500.(Only in Phong Shading).


ATTENTION
-----------
The first time that will run the program, a black screen with no object is going to appear. Just put a colour by using
F1 or F2 or F3 or F4 and left click with the mouse to a point in the screen in order to put the light source.
BONUS: I have implemented Perspective projection, Phong shading and object movement.
